\title{A MCmcmc object from the sbp data}
\description{
This object is included for illustrative purposes. It is a result of
using MCmcmc, with \code{n.iter=100000}.
}
\usage{data(sbp.MC)}
\format{
  The format is a \code{\link{MCmcmc}} object.
}
\details{
  The basic data are measurements of systolic blood pressure from the
  \code{\link{sbp}} dataset. Measurements are taked to be linked within replicate.
  The code used to generate the object was:
  \preformatted{
  library(MethComp)
  data( sbp )
  spb <- Meth( sbp )
  sbp.MC <- MCmcmc( sbp, linked=TRUE, n.iter=100000 ) )
  }
  }
\examples{
data(sbp.MC)
# How was the data generated
attr(sbp.MC,"mcmc.par")
# Conversion between methods and variance components
print.MCmcmc(sbp.MC)
# Traceplots
trace.MCmcmc(sbp.MC)
trace.MCmcmc(sbp.MC,"beta")
# A MCmcmc object also has class mcmc.list, so we can use the
# standard coda functions for covergence diagnostics:
acfplot( subset.MCmcmc(sbp.MC,subset="sigma") )
# Have a look at the correlation between the 9 variance parameters
pairs.MCmcmc( sbp.MC )
# Have a look at wheter the MxI variance componnts are the same between methods:
pairs.MCmcmc( sbp.MC, subset=c("ir"), eq=TRUE,
              panel=function(x,y,...)
                    {
                    abline(0,1)
                    abline(v=median(x),h=median(y),col="gray")
                    points(x,y,...)
                    }
