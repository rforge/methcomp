\title{Measurement of fat content of human milk by two different methods.}
\description{
 Fat content of human milk determined by measurement of glycerol released by
 enzymic hydrolysis of triglycerides (Trig) and measurement by the Standard
 Gerber method (Gerber). Units are (g/100 ml).

\usage{data(milk)}
\format{
  A data frame with 90 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
