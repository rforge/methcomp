\title{Measurements of HbA1c from Steno Diabetes Center}
\description{
Three analysers (machines) for determination of HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin)
were tested on samples from 38 individuals. Each had drawn a venous and capillary
blood sample. These were analysed on five different days.
}
\usage{data(hba1c)}
\format{
  A data frame with 835 observations on the following 6 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{dev}}{Type of machine used.
          A factor with levels \code{BR.V2}, \code{BR.VC} and \code{Tosoh}.}
    \item{\code{type}}{Type of blood analysed (capillary or venous).
          A factor with levels \code{Cap} \code{Ven}}
    \item{\code{item}}{Person-id. A numeric vector}
    \item{\code{d.samp}}{Day of sampling.}
    \item{\code{d.ana}}{Day of laboratory analysis.}
    \item{\code{y}}{The measured value of HbA1c.}
  }
}
\details{
In the terminology of method comparison studies, methods is the
cross-classification of \code{dev} and \code{type}, and replicate is
\code{d.ana}. It may be of interest to look at the effect of time between
\code{d.ana} and \code{d.samp}, i.e. the time between sampling and analysis.
